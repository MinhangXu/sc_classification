# Legacy scripts

This folder keeps historical runners and helper scripts that are useful for provenance but are not the current primary workflow.

## Subfolders

- `replearn_2025/`: dated representation-learning scripts from Aug 2025.
- `pipeline_classic/`: older FA/NMF/LR pipeline entry points.
- `dr_suite/`: the prior DR suite run script lineage.
- `post_RepLearn_analysis/`: post-hoc CFA/FA analysis scripts.
- `factosig_pipeline/`: FactoSig-only run + DR comparison + elastic-net follow-up scripts.
- `factosig_significance/`: cached-fit significance and volcano plotting utilities.
- `notebook_helpers/`: helper `.py` files originally created from notebook troubleshooting.

## Current primary workflow

Use `scripts/comprehensive_run/` for ongoing plan-driven runs.
