# FactoSig significance utilities (legacy)

This folder contains post-fit significance tooling for FactoSig models.

## Files

- `factosig_fit_cache.py`: cache fitted FactoSig arrays to `.npz`.
- `factosig_model_sig_from_cache.py`: model-based significance from cached fit.
- `factosig_bootstrap_from_cache.py`: bootstrap significance from cached fit.
- `factosig_significance_from_experiment.py`: significance directly from an experiment directory.
- `factosig_volcano_plots.py`: per-factor volcano plots from significance outputs.

These scripts are superseded by current comprehensive-run planning but remain
valuable for post-hoc analysis and method comparisons.
