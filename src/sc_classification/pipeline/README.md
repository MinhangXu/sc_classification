# Pipeline folder scope

This folder should contain Python pipeline code, not experiment outputs.

## Migration note (2026-02-13)

Legacy outputs and notebooks were moved out to keep `src/` code-focused:

- Results moved to:
  - `experiments/archive/pipeline_results_legacy_20260213/`
- Notebooks moved to:
  - `notebooks/dr/pipeline_legacy/`
  - `notebooks/multivi/pipeline_legacy/`

The remaining `multiVI_batch_correct/` folder here is code-only.
